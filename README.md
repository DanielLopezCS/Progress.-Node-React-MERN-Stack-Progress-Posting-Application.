# Progress.-Node-React-MERN-Stack-Progress-Posting-Application.
An App where people can upload their progress stories. Functionality include adding and deleting Stories/Events, Filtering by Subcategory, Favorite/Unfavorite functions, Profile creation/view as well as showing stories of user on profile page, comment system. File upload for Stories and Events using Multer. Authentication uses Passport and JSON Session Tokens. Basic validation and much of the backend finished, some Frontend might wanna be reworked before publishing on Heroku but my focus now is on learning more backend techniques and learning more about the Node environment. MongoDB/MLab for Database, Express for backend framework.
